# Termino-Visual: CLI for generating scatterplots from CSV data
### Version 0.1

## Purpose
This is a command line application which accepts .CSV files as arguments at the command line and renders appropriate scatterplots at the command line. For the present iteration, these CSV files must be formatted so that they consist only of 2 columns, and without headers. More sophisticated functionality will be added in later versions.

## Dependencies
For usage of Termino-Visual, the following gemfiles must be installed on your system:
* curses
* descriptive_statistics
